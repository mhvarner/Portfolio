                    <p>
                        This project was very interesting and challenging utilizing API's to simulate data to the use and create working applications. I created travel itineraries using Google APIs which was very interesting. Overall, I learned even more about Python in this module, especially after completing the challenge successfully.

                    <p>
                        This project wanted me to isolate the months of June and December in order to get the statistics of the temperatures of each month in Hawaii (count, max, min, mean, standard deviation, and percentiles). First, I had to use a session query for june and use the extract function through sqlalchemy in order to get the information about the temperatures in order for me then to put that information into a dataframe called june_df. I did the same steps for dec_df dataframe, consolidating the temperatures for each month in each respective dataframe. After this, I did the extract for the total observations for each of the nine stations in both december and june and made a dataframe for each month. I then used the desribe function for each month giving me the stats for each month. I then did a combined dataframe with the June and December months showing the information and stats side by side for easier comparison. Finally, I added a few graphs to give the viewer a visual of the temperatures of each month.

                        This project was about learning how to develop functioning website (using flask) which would scrape information from Nasa's website onto the webpage I developed. Bootstrap is a function apart of Flask which was very fun to use because of all the styling and order methods that I could use to make my website even better.

                    <h2>PyBer_Analysis</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Challenge (In:597-710) V. Isualize gave me was to get in to even more detail with the information in the csv files concerning technical analysis deliverables. The first deliverable was to create a summary DataFrame consisting of many different factors: Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare Per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver. They wanted me to implement that information into a DataFrame with Urban, Suburban, and Rural Cities as indexes shwoing the discrepancy among the three when it came to the numbers. The second deliverable was creating a multiple-line plot showing the sum of the fares for each city type. I analyzed this data utilizing the functions of groupby() and creating different dataframes in order to make this information more concise. Many challenges and difficulties were overcome in this module challenge. Whether it was finding the correct dataframes to use or the correct functions (and even what the functions meant and how they were used), everything seemed like a step in the wrong direction. It was through trial and error experimenting with the groupby() function, loc() function, creating the pivot table (which I had not done before on matplotlib), and setting the indexes that I was able to finally understand how each one was used. I was able to overcome the learning curve of the groupby() function by making smaller groupby function codes and then gradually making longer and longer ones until I mastered it. For the loc function, I had difficulty locating the correct dates needed to plot the multiple line plot but was finally able to work around to fix it using he exact data from under the Date Index. Making the pivot table was not hard, it was a matter of finding which function created the pivot table which was (table = pd.pivot_table(new_fares_data, values='Fare', index=['Date'], columns=['City Type'], aggfunc=np.sum). This one I found the aggfunc=np.sum on stackoverflow and was able to use it correctly. Setting the indexes were easy once I was able to find everythign I needed for them. All in all, the challenges were faced head on and I was able to complete it.

                        For this Challenge, there were two deliverables I had to code in SQL using different queries. The first deliverable the boss wanted was a data chart reflecting the Number of Retiring Employees by Title, where I had to have six columns consisting of Employee number, first name, last name, Title, from_date, and Salary. The second deliverable was to find the mentorship eligibility of the employees which consisted of six columns of Employee number, first name, last name , Title, from_date, and to_date where, according to the challenge description, "to be eligible to participate in the mentorship program, employees will need to have a date of birth that falls between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965."
